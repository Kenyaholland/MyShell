## Set-up Instructions

1. Clone the HTTPS link to a folder that holds your projects.

4. Enter the terminal command shown below. An example is "./prime 4 2 1000"
5. Enjoy

## **Prime**

This program generates all prime numbers that occur within a range of numbers.
The program uses divide-and-conquer to compute prime numbers across all instances within the total specified range.
Ex: 1000 numbers split into 4 sections. 
  - Instance 0: 1-250
  - Instance 1: 250-500 
  - Instance 2: 500-750
  - Instance 3: 750-1000

### **Terminal Command:** ./prime <totalNumInstances> <index> <upperValue>

- **<totalNumInstance>**: This is the total number of instances the shell launches. The number must be positive.
- **<index>**: This is the index of the instance; the number must be zero to <total_numInstances> - 1.
- **<upperValue>**: The largest value to be tested for primality. All numbers between 1 and <upperValue> will be tested for primality.

## **TestMe**

This program is a test program that prints out the instance, the total number of instances, and the range of values each instance processes.

### **Terminal Command:** ./testme <totalNumInstance> <index> <values>

<totalNumInstance>: this is the total number of instances the shell launches; the number must be positive
<index>: this is the index of the instance; the number must be zero to <total_numInstances> - 1
<value>: the values processed by all instances; the number must be a positive value
